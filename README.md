# Environmental-Remediation-Strategies
Exercises of the Environmental Remediation Strategies course

- Plot1.m to learn how to make a graph
- exercise1.m to compute the concentration of TCE in the groundwater after a spill
- exercise2.m to use the ComputeROI (separate *.m file) function to estimate the radius of influence of ISCO, assuming steady-state, radial flow, pseudo-first order degradation kinetics
- ODE.m to apply the solution of a system of ODE to an In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) process
